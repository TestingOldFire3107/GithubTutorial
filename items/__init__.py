"""
The item registry.

Every item type that the game can spawn must be listed in ITEMS below.
When you add a new item, you must do TWO things:
    1. import your class here
    2. add it to the ITEMS list

The game picks a random class from this list each time it spawns something.
Want your item to be rarer? Add it once. Want it to be common? Add it multiple times.
